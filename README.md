# Simple Conference web app
**Technological stack:** C#, ASP.NET, Dapper, SQlite.
**Architecture pattern:** MVC

This simple web app was made as a task during 2-week intership. 
This app can only filter and output conferences (without conference creation form), that already exist in database, because it was made as addition to another app.

It has 4 test entries in db, so plug and play.
